Settings Descriptions

Settings are found in the settings.ini file. Do not rename that file. It should be located in the same folder as your executable file (`OpenVR-Dynamic-Resolution.exe`).

- autoStart: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) Enabling it will launch the program with SteamVR automatically.

- minimizeOnStart: (0 = show, 1 = minimize, 2 = hide) Will automatically minimize or hide the window on launch. 
If set to 2 (hide), you won't be able to exit the program manually, but it will automatically exit with SteamVR.

- initialRes: The resolution the program sets your HMD's resolution when starting. 
Also the resolution that is targeted in vramOnlyMode.

- minRes: The minimum value the program will be allowed to set your HMD's resolution to.

- maxRes: The maximum value the program will be allowed to set your HMD's resolution to.

- dataPullDelayMs: The time in milliseconds (1000ms = 1s) the program waits to pull and display new information. 
Adjust dataAverageSamples accordingly.

- resChangeDelayMs: The delay in milliseconds (1000ms = 1s) between each resolution change. 
Lowering it will make the resolution change more responsive, but will cause more stuttering from resolution changes.

- minCpuTimeThreshold: Don't increase resolution when CPU time in milliseconds is below this value. 
Useful to avoid the resolution increasing in the SteamVR void or during loading screens. Also see resetOnThreshold.

- resIncreaseMin: How many static % to increase resolution when we have GPU or/and VRAM headroom.

- resDecreaseMin: How many static % to decrease resolution when GPU frametime or/and VRAM usage is too high.

- resIncreaseScale: How much to increase resolution depending on GPU frametime headroom.

- resDecreaseScale: How much to decrease resolution depending on GPU frametime excess.

- resIncreaseThreshold: Percentage of the target frametime at which the program will stop increase resolution

- resDecreaseThreshold: Percentage of the target frametime at which the program will stop decreasing resolution

- dataAverageSamples: Number of samples to use for the average GPU time. Depends on dataPullDelayMs.

- resetOnThreshold: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) Enabling will reset the resolution to initialRes whenever minCpuTimeThreshold is met. 
Useful if you wanna go from playing a supported game to an unsuported games without having to reset your resolution/the program/SteamVR.

- alwaysReproject: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) Enabling will double the target frametime, 
so if you're at a target FPS of 120, it'll target 60. Useful if you have a bad CPU but good GPU.

- vramTarget: The target VRAM usage in percents. Once your VRAM usage exceeds this amount, the resolution will stop increasing.

- vramLimit: The maximum VRAM usage in percents. Once your VRAM usage exceeds this amount, the resolution will start decreasing.

- vramMonitorEnabled: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) If enabled, vram specific features will be enabled, 
otherwise it is assumed that free vram is always available.

- vramOnlyMode: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) Only adjust resolution based off VRAM; 
ignore GPU and CPU frametimes. Will always stay at initialRes or lower (if VRAM limit is reached).

- preferReprojection: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) If enabled, the GPU target frametime will double as soon 
as the CPU frametime is over the target frametime; else, the CPU frametime needs to be 2 times greater than 
the target frametime for the GPU target frametime to double.

- ignoreCpuTime: (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled) Don't use the CPU frametime to adjust resolution.

- disabledApps: Space-delimited list of OpenVR application keys that should be ignored for resolution adjustment. 
Steam games use the format steam.app.APPID, e.g. steam.app.438100 for VRChat and steam.app.620980 for Beat Saber.
